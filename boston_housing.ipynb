In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: ** for max_depth=1,the training and testing curves are almost equal .as the max_depth increases,the no.of training  points are decreasing,testing points are increasing and the curves are diverging. If curves are close and at a lower score the model is underfitting and if the curves are far apart the model is overfitting.what i understand is,We can see how the  testing score (green line) increases with the number of observations.However, the testing score only increases to approximately 0.4, a low score.\n",
    "This indicates how the model does not generalize well for new, unseen, data.\n",
    "Moreover, the training score (red line) decreases with the number of observations.\n",
    "Also, the training score decreases to a very low score of approximately 0.4.\n",
    "This indicates how the model does not seem to fit the data well.\n",
    "Thus, we can say this model is facing a high bias problem. Consequently, having more training points would not benefit the model as the model is underfitting the dataset. Instead, one should increase the model complexity to better fit the dataset.\n",
    "Morever, the teting score has reached a plateau suggesting the model may not improve from adding more training points. \n"

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: ** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high       variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well).High variance models have a gap between the training and validation scores.High bias models have have a small or no gap between the training and validations scores.therefore the model trained with max depth=1 suffer with high bias.both the testing and training scores are low.and this couldn't fit the data well hence suffers high bias.\n",

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "EXAMPLE:in SVM,if we try to use multiple c values and gamma values,The grid search algorithm will take in the scoring function (to check the best possible combination) the dataset as well as the object of the SVC and will result the values of gamma and c which will give us the best possible value of the SVC."

    "**Answer: **K-fold cv is a method of splitting the training data into training and cross-validation sets.when evaluating different settings (“hyperparameters”) for estimators,there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the estimator performs optimally. so,the data is divided into 3 sets namely training ,validation and testing sets.this will drastically decrease the no. of training sets.To solve this k-fold cross validation technique is used. A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets (other approaches are described below, but generally follow the same principles). The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:\n",
    "-->A model is trained using k-1 of the folds as training data;\n",
    "-->the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy)."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
